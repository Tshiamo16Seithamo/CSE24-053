      <h2>Refined Excess: The Language of Modern Luxury Cars</h2>

      <p>Luxury in today’s automotive world is no longer just leather seats and quiet cabins — it’s cinematic screens, gesture controls, and AI-assisted driving. Where classics were defined by restraint, modern luxury is about experience, personalization, and technological sophistication.</p>

        <figcaption>Visual dominance: Bold color, exotic geometry, and sheer presence.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>The Dashboard as Theater</h3>
      <p>Open the door to a Mercedes EQS or BMW i7 and you're greeted by more pixels than an editing suite:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Panoramic glass dashboards</li>
        <li>Ambient mood lighting</li>
        <li>Voice-command assistants that say your name</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We’ve shifted from analog purity to digital immersion — where a car is part lounge, part device.</p>

      <h3>Comfort Meets Intelligence</h3>
      <p>Modern luxury is experiential:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adaptive suspension that reads the road</li>
        <li>Fragrance diffusers, massaging seats</li>
        <li>Parking assist that performs ballet in tight spaces</li>
      </ul>

        <figcaption>Crafted experience: Bentley’s cockpit blends elegance, comfort, and visual command.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>These features aren’t just extras — they’re signals of innovation, refinement, and prestige.</p>

      <h3>A Design Critique</h3>
      <p>There’s brilliance in modern luxury. But there’s also risk:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Too much tech can isolate the driver from the machine</li>
        <li>Design becomes more about surface and screen, less about feel and form</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Image 3: Mercedes G-Wagon -->
      <figure class="post-image">
        <img src="images/luxury-gwagon.jpg" alt="Mercedes-Benz G-Class parked among trees with V8 BITURBO badge and red brake calipers">
        <figcaption>Prestige meets presence: The G-Class embodies power, geometry, and luxury heritage.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Minimalism is often a statement of confidence — luxury tends to layer signals of status. When done well, though, modern design balances both.</p>

      <blockquote>“Luxury isn’t excess. It’s detail delivered with grace.”</blockquote>
