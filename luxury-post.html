      <h2>Refined Excess: The Language of Modern Luxury Cars</h2>

      <p>Luxury in today’s automotive world is no longer just leather seats and quiet cabins — it’s cinematic screens, gesture controls, and AI-assisted driving. Where classics were defined by restraint, modern luxury is about experience, personalization, and technological sophistication.</p>

      <h3>The Dashboard as Theater</h3>
      <p>Open the door to a Mercedes EQS or BMW i7 and you're greeted by more pixels than an editing suite:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Panoramic glass dashboards</li>
        <li>Ambient mood lighting</li>
        <li>Voice-command assistants that say your name</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We’ve shifted from analog purity to digital immersion — where a car is part lounge, part device.</p>

      <h3>Buttons Gone, Sensors In</h3>
      <p>Many luxury brands are moving toward full-screen interfaces:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Haptic feedback replaces clicky switches</li>

        <li>Adaptive suspension that reads the road</li>
        <li>Fragrance diffusers, massaging seats</li>
        <li>Parking assist that performs ballet in tight spaces</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These features aren’t just extras — they’re signals of innovation, refinement, and prestige.</p>

      <h3>A Design Critique</h3>
      <p>There’s brilliance in modern luxury. But there’s also risk:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Too much tech can isolate the driver from the machine</li>
        <li>Design becomes more about surface and screen, less about feel and form</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Minimalism is often a statement of confidence — luxury tends to
